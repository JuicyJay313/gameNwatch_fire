# Game N Watch Fire

Game & Watch: Fire remake

Originally developed by Nintendo in 1980 on a small dedicated handheld console designed 
for a single game. It was later ported and remade in 1997 on the Game Boy handheld console 
as part of a compilation titled "Game and Watch Gallery".

This version is inspired by the GB remake from the compilation in terms of artstyle and resolution.  
It is written in lua and runs on the LOVE2d engine.
